    "## Double Deep Q-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "As before with the tabular Q-learning (part 1 of this tutorial), Double Deep Q-learning seeks to learn the \"quality\" function $Q(s,a)$. The difference in this case is that instead of using a table to store all the values of Q(s,a), we are going to use a Neural Network to approximate the unknown function $Q(s,a)$.\n",

    "Neural networks can be seen as differentiable graphs where information can flow in two ways: forward way and backward way. For instance, consider the one neuron neural network shown in the figure. Here, the information flowing in the forward way is shown in color blue, and the information flowing in the backward way is shown in color red.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward way, or forward pass, is used to perform a series of math operations on the flowing information. This math operations are determined by the structure of the network (i.e. the connections, the activation functions, etc.) and the parameters of the network (i.e. weights and biases). On the other hand, the backward way, or backward pass, is used to distribute gradients of errors that will be used to update the parameters of the network, and hence, train the network to approximate a desired unknown function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of training a neural network can be summarized in the following steps:\n",
    "* 1. Feedforward an input of data (forward pass).\n",
    "* 2. Compute a loss between the network's output and the desired output.\n",
    "* 3. Backpropagate the gradient of the loss w.r.t each of the parameters of the network (backward pass).\n",
    "* 4. Use an optimization algorithm (i.e. gradient descent) to update the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps are repeated until a stop criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets derive the expressions for a single iteration of these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: forward pass\n",
    "Assume the network receives an input of the form: $\\color{blue}{X} = [\\color{blue}{x_1},\\color{blue}{x_2},\\color{blue}{x_3}]^T$. Then, the feedforward equations are:\n",

    "## A multi-layer neural network\n",
    "In our single neuron example we assumed that the input of the neuron was a vector of data. However, the input of the neuron could also be the output of a previous layer in the network, and the gradients w.r.t the input would be the gradients backproagating to the previous layer. Once one understands this, it is straightforward to extrapolate the training procedure to networks with multiple layers and neurons.\n",

    "Consider the 2 layer neural network in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](imgs/nn_v2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this network each layer is a group of neurons and each of these neurons has its own set of weights and biases. Also, each neuron in one layer is connected to all the outputs of the previous layer. For example, in the case of the layer 1, each neuron is connected to every input $(\\color{blue}X)$, and, in the case of layer 2, each neuron is connected to each output of the layer 1 $(\\color{blue}Y)$.\n",

    "The training procedure is exactly the same as with the one neuron neural network, the only change is in the size of the matrices.\n",

    "For instance consider receiving an input matrix $\\color{blue}X$ of size $d\\times m$. Here $d$ is the dimension of the input examples (i.e. in our one-neuron network example $d$ was $3$) and $m$ is the number of examples that we are going to feedforward to the network per training iteration (i.e. in our one-neuron network example $m$ was $1$). The term $m$ is known as the batch size and using $m>1$ usually allows faster and smoother training. Consider also a first layer with $n_1$ neurons and a second layer (output layer) with $n_2$ neurons. Under these asumptions the dimensions of the different matrices are:\n",

    "# Now, lets dive into Double Deep Q-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in Part 1 of this tutorial, tabular Q-learning seeks to learn a table with $|S|$ rows and $|A|$ columns. In this table each entry is the Q-value of the corresponding state-action pair. In this tabular form the Q-learning update is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    Q(s_t,a_t) = Q(s_t,a_t) + \\alpha[r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_{\\hat{a}}Q(s_{t+1},\\hat{a}) - Q(s_t,a_t)]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that it is straighforward to implement this in code and that we can achieve optimal results. However, the tabular form fails to work when we deal with continuous or very big state spaces (i.e. we wont be able to build the required table).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve this problem we can approximate the function $Q(s,a)$ with a neural network. In order to do so we need to re-define the update rule in the form of a loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in tabular Q-learning, the quantity that we want to minimize is the Bellman Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    BE = r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_{\\hat{a}}Q(s_{t+1},\\hat{a}) - Q(s_t,a_t)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we can define the squared Bellman error as our loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    L = \\frac{1}{2}\\bigg(r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_{\\hat{a}}Q(s_{t+1},\\hat{a}) - Q(s_t,a_t)\\bigg)^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that this loss has the exact same shape as the loss function used in our vanilla neural network tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    L = \\frac{1}{2}\\big(\\hat{z} - z\\big)^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the target $\\hat{z}$ (desired output) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\hat{z} = r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_{\\hat{a}}Q(s_{t+1},\\hat{a})\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    z = Q(s_t,a_t)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the previous supervised learning approach of our vanilla neural network, and the reinforcement learning approach used in this case, is that in the first one we knew the correct desired outputs $\\hat{z}$ (we had a list of data with the desired outputs given the inputs), while in the reinforcement learning aproach, the desired output $\\hat{z}$, for the state-action pair $(s_t, a_t)$, is a moving target based on the received inmediate reward, and an estimate of the Q-value of the next state that results when taking action $a_t$ at state $s_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that we have a moving target is an undesired property for the stability of the neural network training process. To stabilize the training process, we can use two different neural networks: one to predict $Q(s_t,a_t)$ and one to predict the estimation inside the target: $\\max_{\\hat{a}}Q(s_{t+1},\\hat{a})$. The use of these two distinct neural networks is what gives rise to the name: **Double Deep Q-learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the use of two neural networks, it is also a common practice to use a replay memory buffer to provide data to the networks while training. This allows for a more efficient use of data and a more stable training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Double Deep Q-learning algorithm can be summarized as follows.\n",
