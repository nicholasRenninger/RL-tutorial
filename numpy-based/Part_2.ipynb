    "\n",
    "As before with the tabular Q-learning (part 1 of this tutorial), Double Deep Q-learning seeks to learn the \"quality\" function $Q(s,a)$. The difference in this case is that instead of using a table to store all the values of $Q(s,a)$, we are going to use a Neural Network to approximate the unknown function $Q(s,a)$.\n",

    "Neural networks can be seen as differentiable graphs where information can flow in two ways: forward way and backward way. For instance, consider the one neuron neural network shown in the figure. Here, the information flowing in the forward way is shown in color blue, and the information flowing in the backward way is shown in color red (the black arrows indicate the direction of the forward way).\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward way, or forward pass, is used to perform a series of math operations on the flowing information. This math operations are determined by the structure of the network (i.e. the connections, the activation functions, etc.) and the parameters of the network (i.e. weights and biases). On the other hand, the backward way, or backward pass, is used to distribute gradients of errors that will be used to update the parameters of the network, and hence, train the network to approximate a desired unknown function.\n",
